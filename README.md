# Standard Edition vs. Quality Edition
You may notice that the software has two different versions. The quality edition is a 
completely restructured version of the standard edition that is still in development.
It has been rewritten to be cleaner and more compatable with external software; other
than that, it is almost identical in function to the standard edition.
